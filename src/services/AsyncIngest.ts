/**
 * Main-thread client for the telemetry worker's ingest RPCs.
 *
 * The HTTP handlers for POST /v1/traces and POST /v1/logs call into
 * this service instead of `TelemetryStore.ingestTraces/Logs`. Each
 * method sends a typed message to the worker, awaits the reply, and
 * returns the worker's result as an Effect. While the worker is
 * serialising a big batch into SQLite, the main thread's event loop
 * is FREE to answer /api/* queries — that's the whole point of the
 * offload. Without this, /api/health and friends queued behind long
 * ingests and reported p95 latencies of 3-5 seconds; after, they
 * stay responsive regardless of ingest load.
 *
 * The worker is spawned as a scope'd resource inside the layer. The
 * protocol pool is sized at 1 because SQLite only supports a single
 * writer at a time anyway — running N concurrent workers would just
 * queue them on SQLite's lock. When the outer scope closes (server
 * shutdown), `BunWorker.layer`'s finalizer sends a close message and
 * terminates the worker if it doesn't exit gracefully in 5s.
